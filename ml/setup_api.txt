How the API works?:
When the user starts a training or predict job... the web server adds a command to the databse and the launches the corresponding ec2 instance.
This ec2 instance launches and runs a script that looks for the command in the database and then runs a job based off it.

To set up an ec2 for training or prediction you'll need to install all prerequisites for running the code (to be detailed later?)

Then in the ec2 instance of your choice run:
  ''' sudo crontab -e '''
In the file that opens you can specify jobs to run at certain times.


In order to have the ec2 run training jobs on startup add the line.

''' @reboot sudo runuser -l ubuntu -c '/home/ubuntu/video-annotation-tool/ml/run_training.sh' '''

In order to have the ec2 run prediction jobs on startup add the line.

''' @reboot sudo runuser -l ubuntu -c '/home/ubuntu/video-annotation-tool/ml/run_predict.sh' '''
