This is an explanation of how to set up an ec2 instance as a server 
to recieve annotation data and use it to generate further annotation 
data using opencv tracking methods.


First have to set up the ec2 instance, choose an ubutuntu server AMI, and make 
sure to add extra storage space(NOT MEMORY, 32Gigs on an ssd should be enough).

1. SETTING UP OPENCV AND OTHER PACKAGES
	SSH into the ec2 instance and follow
	https://www.pyimagesearch.com/opencv-tutorials-resources-guides/
	to set up opencv 4, make sure to add '-DWITH_FFMPEG=ON' to the cmake command. 
	You'll probably have to downloada a couple of extra packages along the way.
	Confirm that it is working with 'python -c 'import cv2; print(cv2.__version__);'

	*** Make sure to be doing everything on python 3.6 and in a virtual env (we named ours 'cv')***
	You'll have to pip install a bunch of packages (WHILE IN VENV) to get the script working.
        (Hopefully we can make a requirements.txt)

	As well as 
	sudo apt install ffmpeg
	sudo apt-get install libpq-dev

2. GETTING ANNOTATIONS
	Just run 'python annotateAll.py >status.txt 2>error.txt &' to begin automatic annotations.
	Can view status with 'tail status.txt'.
	This script runs constantly, looking up unprocessed annotations and tracking for any it finds.


HELPFUL SQL QUERIES:

Lists any duplicated annotations (possibly generated when stopping and starting the script):

SELECT (annotations.image)::text, count(*)
FROM annotations
GROUP BY annotations.image
HAVING count(*) > 1;

Removes any duplicate annotations:

DELETE FROM annotations T1
USING   annotations T2
WHERE   T1.id < T2.id
AND T1.image  = T2.image;
