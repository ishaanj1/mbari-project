This is an explanation of how to set up an ec2 instance as a server 
to recieve annotation data and use it to generate further annotation 
data using opencv tracking methods.


First have to set up the ec2 instance, choose an ubutuntu server AMI, and make 
sure to add extra storage space(NOT MEMORY, 32Gigs on an ssd should be enough).

1. SETTING UP OPENCV
	SSH into the ec2 instance and follow
	https://www.pyimagesearch.com/opencv-tutorials-resources-guides/
	to set up opencv, make sure to add '-DWITH_FFMPEG=ON' to the cmake command. You'll have to download
	a couple of extra packages along the way, and make sure to update paths to point to the correct places.
	*** Make sure to be doing everything on python 3.6 and in a virtual env***
	Confirm that it is working with 'python -c 'import cv2; print(cv2.__version__);'
	(Hopefully we can have a test script at some point)
	You'll have to pip install a bunch of packages (WHILE IN VENV)
	pip install python-dotenv
	As well as 
	'sudo apt install ffmpeg'
	'sudo apt-get install libpq-dev'

2. Just run 'nohup python annotateAll.py &' to begin automatic annotationins 


DELETE FROM annotations T1
    USING   annotations T2
WHERE   T1.id < T2.id  -- delete the older versions
    AND T1.image  = T2.image;
